            <p> My mission is to use computer science as a way to bring together creativity, logic, and impact. I want to design technology that’s not only functional but also approachable, beautiful, and empowering—whether that’s writing clean, efficient code, organizing data so it makes sense, or building user experiences that feel fun and intuitive. I value both the puzzle-solving side of CS (figuring out how things work, debugging, optimizing) and the storytelling side (crafting projects that connect to people’s lives).
                I’m committed to growing my technical skills in programming, software development, and data analysis while staying true to my values of collaboration, creativity, and responsibility. Long-term, I want my work in computer science to make a difference—whether in research, tech innovation, or real-world applications—while also reflecting who I am: someone who blends logic with imagination, organization with playfulness, and determination with heart.
